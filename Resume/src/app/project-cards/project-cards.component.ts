      introduction: 'This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD) from 2006 to October 25 2019.',
      description: ' The dataset is updated annually and is updated and maintained by Police Department (NYPD). The Goal of the project is to predict the level of offense (felony, misdemeanor, violation) depending on different factors associated with the registered complaint and analyze the factors in the dataset leading to the increase or decrease of crime rates in the dataset. The target variable (Level of offense) is categorical in nature and thus Generalized Logistic regression and K-Nearest Neighbor method can be implemented to predict the class of the target variable.',

      introduction: 'An MNIST dataset is used and the goal of the analysis is to build a model which can accurately classify the images as one of the digits between 0 and 9.',
      description: 'Logistic Regression is a method for performing predictive analysis by determining the relation between the dependent variable which is categorical or binary in nature and one or more independent variables. This method of regression is used only when the dependent variable is categorical (Yes or No, or 0 or 1). For instance, to identify an email is a spam or not (Yes or no), a logistic regression can be used. The algorithm gives a probability which can be used to translate the output into one of the classes (Yes or No) (Swaminathan, 2018).',

      description: 'The company collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 distinct products, and has 10 stores spread across different cities (Analytics Vidhya, 2016). The data is divided into two broad categories which are Product level and Outlet level properties. Based on these properties the predictive model would help the company determine the expected sales of each product at a particular store and would also help identify feature importance. Help the company determine properties of products as well as outlets that have a high or medium impact on the sales.',
